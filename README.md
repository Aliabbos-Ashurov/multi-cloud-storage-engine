# Advanced Multi-Cloud File Storage

This project demonstrates an advanced-level implementation of a **multi-cloud file storage system** using **Spring Boot
**. It supports dynamic provider selection (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) and incorporates best practices such as
asynchronous processing, caching, retries, and observability.

---

## Features

**Multi-Cloud Support**: Seamlessly switch between AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.  
**Asynchronous Operations**: Perform uploads, downloads, and deletions asynchronously for better performance.
**Support YAML config** able to work with yaml configurations
**Observability**: Integrated metrics and logging for monitoring and debugging.  
**Clean Code**: Follows SOLID principles, design patterns, and senior-level engineering practices.

## future release

**Caching**: Cache frequently accessed files to reduce latency and improve throughput.  
**Retry Mechanism**: Built-in retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures.  
**Configurable**: Fine-grained configurations for retries, timeouts, and connection pooling.
